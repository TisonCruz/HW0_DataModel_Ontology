Altibase is described as a enterprise grade, high performance, relational
database. They have the richest installation base in the world and has "over 650
global enterprise clients", and big name tech partners such as hp, samsung, lg,
and many more. But what makes the database interesting and unique from the other
data models is that it has a hybrid architecture. It combines an in-memory
database as well as a disk resident database in one engine, saying that it is 10
times faster than conventional on-disk databases.
