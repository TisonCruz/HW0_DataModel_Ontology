DBVisualizer is a universal database tool that connects to most major databases
and JDBC drivers. It is open-source because it allows you to download it for
free but there is an option to pay for other additional things. DBVisualizer
follows the object-oriented data model and they also boast about having some of
the most satisfied client/server relationship. Java can be used by accessing the
DBVisualizer installation and set the "DBVIS_JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the root directory for the Java installation", as described in the
[DBVisualizer Java help page](https://support.dbvis.com/support/solutions/articles/1000231944-how-do-i-change-the-java-version-that-dbvisualizer-use-).
