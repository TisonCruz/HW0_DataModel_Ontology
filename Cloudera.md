### Cloudera

[Website](https://www.cloudera.com)

Cloudera is a 100% open source hadoop distribution. Cloudera Operational
Database, or COD, is a relational and non-relational database, often calling
itself a hybrid data platform for more freedom. [The Cloudera Documentation](https://docs.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/upgrade/topics/cm_ag_migrate_postgres_db.html) states that "cloudera Manager provides an embedded PostgreSQL database server", showing that the database is embedded. Installing
python on the cluster and set the corresponding PYSPARK_PYTHON environment
variable to the project, then the default cloudera data science workbench engine
is able to work in tandem with python.
