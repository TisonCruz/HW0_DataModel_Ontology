### Hadoop

[Website](https://hadoop.apache.org)

The Hadoop software library is a framework that "allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models." It is a commercial tool. Hadoop falls under the dimensional data model,
as it is known for clustering large datasets across multiple computers to analyze
these datasets more efficently and quickly([source](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/hadoop/what-is-hadoop/)). Since hadoop uses multiple computers, they are
apart of the client/server or cloud hosting model. To connect hadoop with python,
you must install the libhdfs3 library which allows hadoop to connect with python.
